Standardization of gamesegment lists:

    Must Include:
    - thumbnail
    - title
    - summary (to a certain character limit)
    - genre
    - view count
    - publish date (Month, year)
    - user
    - game

    Optional (depending on area):
    - average retention rate
    - game number

    Should Look Like (in large list):
    thumbnail         |         Title (along with a dropdown menu showing game)
    thumbnail (cont.) | Summary
    thumbnail (cont.) | user               Genre
    thumbnail (cont.) | views            Publish Date

    Should Look Like (in small list):
    thumbnail
    thumbnail (cont.)
    thumbnail (cont.)

    Notes:
    - gamesegment width and height should all be the same, regardless of thumbnail width and height
    - probably shouldn't have a border
    - however, might want to make background slightly different then gsegment background, say, grey and white
    - on hover, should offer colored buttons as options, rather than changing background color
