*go through deployment checklist
*clean data coming into game segment files
*figure out how to serve those files
*implement consistent page margins
*reorg file system, like change research DYNAMIC_URL= or something and make static things actually static
*change the file system again, since people can have the same password
*change the secret key, so it doesn't mess things up every time the app is redeployed

Known Bugs:

*for playGame.html, the list of gamesegments changes based on the last one clicked
*average views of a gamesegment are ONLY based on hidden statements, so it only really works for the first time someone tabs out of the website on page reload - fixed i think
*cookie accept tag requires users to click it twice
*when playing a gamesegment, that gamesegment can appear in the reccommend gsegments in the sidebar
